# Title
Use draw.io for domain modelling

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to construct a diagram for our domain model.

## Decision
We decided to use draw.io for several reasons as it's a top-rated confluence diagramming solution since 2013. It is also versatile and easy-to-use, with both ready-made and customizable elements. Draw.io works on desktop or mobile instances. 


## Consequences
Full version control is embedded in Confluence’s version history. It supports ISO 9001 processes through extensive indexing and a diagram change log and offers excellent revision processing and a powerful built-in search. Use pre-designed shapes, snapshots, and SVG images. You can easily drag and drop images and elements directly into the application, import your own image libraries, and easily import / export diagrams to exactly where you need them. You can quickly switch from another charting plugin to draw.io and use a mass import feature to replace all your diagrams with draw.io diagram in just one step.

However it lacks advanced features and is not up to the mark when compared to other online tools. It can be a bit slow at times, especially since working on a browser. Can be subjected to a few lags. As a result of these lags and occasional glitches, you may lose progress in some of your work and it might not be saved in real time. Exporting the diagrams can be challenging. The interface looks outdated and old-fashioned and it does not support advanced design features such as working in dark mode. There are no keyboard shortcuts to make work more efficient.
