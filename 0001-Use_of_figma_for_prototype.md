# Title
We used figma to create our low level prototype

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to use a tool/method to create a low-level prototype, we have multiple options:
* Figma
* Protopie
* Whiteboard
* Balsamiq

## Decision
We decided to use figma to create a low-level prototype to showcase potentially how the website would look like.

## Consequences
Figma allowed us to seamlessly create a prototype. The features in Figma made it easy to showcase some functionality and give a somewhat realistic representation of how the website operates
