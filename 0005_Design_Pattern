# Title
Factory Design In Visa Application System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We have to choose a design pattern to a component in our visa application system. 

## Decision
We will be using the factory design pattern to implement the different types of visa applications that need to be processed in the system. 

## Consequences
The Factory Method separates the construction code  from the code that uses it. As a result, it is easy to extend the product construction code separately from the rest of the code.
