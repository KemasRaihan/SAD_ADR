# Title
Scenario-Based Architecture Analysis Method For Architecture Validation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We have to choose an architecture validation approach to validate a part of the visa application system.

## Decision
We will be using the Scenario-Based Architecture Analysis to validate the visa application process component in our system. 

## Consequences
Problems found early in the software lifecycle are easier to correct. The Software quality will not be appended late in the project.
Furthermore, the candidate architecture can be described in a syntactic architectural notation that is well-understood by the parties involved in the analysis. 
Finally, we can develop direct and indirect task scenarios that illustrate the kinds of activities the system must support and the kinds of changes which it is anticipated will be made to the system over time.
